## Welcome to my Github Profile ðŸ‘‹

My name is Awadhy and I work full time as an Apprentice Software Engineer at Arm in my third and final year of the Degree Apprenticeship programme.

I enjoy learning more about Computer Science and bettering my skill set.

On my Github profile you will find some hobby projects that I am building to improve and consolidate my understanding of C++, as well as any other technologies that I am curious about.
